/**
 * The span Si of the stock’s price on a given day i is defined as the maximum number of consecutive
 * days just before the given day, for which the price of the stock on the current day is less than
 * or equal to its price on the given day.
 * 
 * For example, if an array of 7 days prices is given as {100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85}, then the
 * span values for corresponding 7 days are {1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6}
 * 
 * Trick - start traversing from the end and just find the next greater element and count the days
 * in between
